Coding standards for test, domain knowledge, and preferences that AI should follow.

-   Execute the test file and iterate until the test passes
-   Front-end tests are in js/Pages; put each test in a separate file named after the page it tests.
-   When running frontend tests interrupt at first failure to avoid cascading errors.
-   Use mocked data instead of real data where possible.
